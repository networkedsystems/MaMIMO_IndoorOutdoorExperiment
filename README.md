# MaMIMO_IndoorOutdoorExperiment
This repository includes Matlab scripts to process the uplink channel data collected in an indoor-outdoor experiment using KULeuven Massive MIMO testbed.

Authors: Andrea P. Guevara, Cheng-Ming Chen. 2019

## Instructions

1. Select your MaMIMO antenna distribution (collocated or distributed) according each outdoor experiment detailed here: https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/telemic/research/NetworkedSystems/projects/massive-mimo
2. Download the data set to be proccesed in the same folder with the attached Matlab scripts. <br>
